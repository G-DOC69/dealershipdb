# Dealership Database Project

## Project Overview
This project is a fully-functional database for a car dealership system. It is designed to be expandable, supporting future growth such as multiple dealership locations. The database includes users, cars, photos, events, and contact messages, along with AI-generated SQL views for business insights.

## Project Structure and Files

### SQL Files

- **`sql/create_tables.sql`**  
  Creates the database and the initial tables. Users can copy this code to recreate the database structure exactly as used in this project.

- **`sql/indexes.sql`**  
  Contains the SQL commands to optimize the database using indexes. Users can copy and apply this code to improve query performance.

- **`sql/views_generated_by_ai.sql`**  
  Contains the SQL views generated by the AI agent based on the business problems outlined in the project. These views provide insights like most popular car brands, lowest mileage cars, and cars/events without photos.

### Documentation

- **`docs/problem_statement.md`**  
  Contains the description of the database project, its purpose, and the business problems it aims to solve. This file is also used by the AI agent to generate views. Readers can edit this file to clarify instructions for the AI if needed.

- **`docs/dealership.pdf`**  
  Provides the ER diagram of the database, showing all tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships.

### Jupyter Notebooks

- **`ipynb/insert_data.ipynb`**  
  Contains code to generate fake data using Faker for populating the database. Users can run this notebook to populate the tables with sample data. Any errors can be ignored; the code is fully copyable.

- **`ipynb/ai-agent.ipynb`**  
  Contains the AI agent code that reads the business problems and generates SQL views automatically. Users must update their API key and file paths in this notebook. After setting these, the code is fully copyable.

## Usage Order
1. Run `sql/create_tables.sql` to create the database structure.
2. Run `sql/indexes.sql` to add indexes and optimize the database.
3. Populate the database by running `ipynb/insert_data.ipynb`.
4. Use `ipynb/ai-agent.ipynb` to generate views based on business problems.
5. The generated views will be stored in `sql/views_generated_by_ai.sql`.

## Notes
- This project uses AI-generated SQL for business insights.
- The fake data generation is for testing and demonstration purposes.
- Make sure to update API keys and file paths in the AI agent notebook before running it.
