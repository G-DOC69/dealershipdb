Project Summary: Database Analysis and AI Agent Integration

Overview

This project involved designing and analyzing a database solution
capable of supporting real business tasks. The work included dataset
selection, identification of business problems, schema design, database
creation, optimization, and integration of an AI agent to assist with
data-driven decision‑making.

Completed Work

1.  Dataset Selection
    -   A structured dataset was selected to allow meaningful analysis
        and clear problem formulation.
    -   Data was reviewed for consistency, completeness, and suitability
        for SQL‑based analytics.
2.  Business Problem Identification Several logical and relevant
    business problems were identified, including:
    -   Customer Activity Analysis: Determine the most active users to
        understand engagement and optimize outreach.
    -   Performance Insights: Identify products, categories, or services
        with declining performance.
    -   Operational Efficiency: Detect delays, bottlenecks, or anomalies
        in workflows.
    -   Revenue Tracking: Analyze fluctuations in revenue to support
        financial planning.
    -   Forecasting Needs: Prepare the database for future predictive
        queries handled by the AI agent.
3.  Database Schema Design
    -   All required tables were defined along with their relationships.
    -   A unified ER diagram was created to represent the structure.
    -   The schema ensures referential integrity, normalization, and
        clarity for future expansion.
4.  Database Creation and Population
    -   The schema was implemented in the database engine.
    -   Tables were filled with appropriate filler data to enable
        realistic testing.
    -   Integrity constraints and standard validations were applied.
5.  Optimization Work
    -   Indexes were added to improve query performance.
    -   Relevant views were created for simplifying analytical tasks.
    -   The database was prepared to efficiently handle both manual and
        AI‑generated queries.
6.  AI Agent Integration
    -   An AI agent was introduced to operate within Jupyter.
    -   Its purpose is to:
        -   Assist in SQL query generation.
        -   Interpret data results.
        -   Provide recommendations based on business problems.
        -   Support team members in analyzing operational patterns.
    -   The model is integrated through a clean API structure, ensuring
        reliable and repeatable interactions.

Frameworks & Technoligies

Throughout this project, we utilized a broad set of technologies,
frameworks, and languages to design, implement, and analyze the database system.
For database development and optimization, we worked with MySQL alongside
MySQL Workbench to create tables, to generate filler data, and design the ER-diagram.
For text editing and testing, we used IntelliJ IDEA as the main development environment.
Data generation and AI-assisted querying were performed in Jupyter Notebook using Python,
supported by libraries such as Faker, standard Python I/O, and the Google Generative AI API
for large-language-model interaction. Additionally, we incorporated SQL for schema creation,
indexing, querying, and view generation, and Markdown (.md) files to document the problem
statement and technical details. We also used dbdiagram.io to visualize and export the ER diagram
in PDF format. Together, these tools enabled us to build a functional database, populate it with
realistic data, and develop an AI-augmented workflow for generating analytical SQL views.

Final Outcome

The result is a fully prepared and optimized database system supported
by an AI‑powered analytical assistant. The completed setup allows clear
demonstration of: - Business understanding - Data analysis skills -
Database engineering - AI‑driven decision support
